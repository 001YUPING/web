				<h4>ORID</h4>

				<p>The ORID (Objective, Reflective, Interpretive, Decisional) method is a form of a structured conversation that should be ideally led by a facilitator. By listing out objective, reflection, interpretation toward a certain topic, the process naturally guides participants to a consensus decision. When facing a more complex topic, it's often used for structuring conversation, helping converge discussion and highlight key issues. Fast-paced ideation in a smaller group could also apply ORID by quickly underlining fact, feeling, idea and then arrives at a short-term decision.<br><a href="http://pacific-edge.info/2010/08/orid/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://pacific-edge.info/2010/08/orid/</a></p>
