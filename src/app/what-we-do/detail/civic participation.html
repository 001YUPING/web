The year 1996 brought the first presidential election and the world-wide web. Internet and democracy evolved together, spread together, and integrated with each other. The word 'free' in free software has been focused on its social impact as in 'freedom'. By the end of 2014, city-level elections brought many occupiers into local governments. On the national level, the new Premier reached out to civic hackers to reinvent policymaking.

                        When Uber started riding with its epidemic meme of "sharing economy", Jaclyn Tsai, the Minister in charge of cyberspace affairs at the time, wanted a discussion that involves all stakeholders. Taiwan doesn't have a *commission nationale du d√©bat public, so the Minister joined g0v hackers to invent a deliberative process.

                         Deliberation, thinking deeply about something together, is an effective vaccine against a virus of the mind. When everyone-passengers and drivers, academics and public servants -listened to each other and formed a consensus, we become immune to divisive PR campaigns in the future.

                         After Uber, the Airbnb deliberation also went well, with Airbnb sending email to all their Taiwan members, urging them to participate online. Airbnb's co-founder then visited Taiwan and pledged agreement on all consensus items.

                     <p>A proper deliberation involves four stages:</p><br>
                     <p>- Facts: "What do we know?"</p>
                     <p>- Feelings: "How do we react?"</p>
                     <p>- Ideas: "What are the possibilities?"</p>
                     <p>- Decisions: "What can we all agree on?"</p><br>
                     <p>
                         However, if the decision-making process is not transparent, we don't get access to same facts as the policy-makers. Without considering relevant facts and everyone's feelings, ideas become ideologies - viruses of the mind that blind people to new facts and to each other's feelings.

                        So our first step is open data, that is, making all the facts available. Not just numbers, but also meeting records, Studies, analyses - the minister publishes all materials she receives, so everyone can be on the same page.

                        Next, we created an interactive survey. We presented participants in groups and showed yes-or-no statements, one at a time, above them. Each participant had an avatar, and when someone clicked "agree" or "disagree", their avatar moved toward a group of avatars representing those with similar feelings. The next statement then showed up; everyone could contribute their statements for others to vote on.

                         On May 23, the administration pledged to ratify all the deliberation's consensus items into a new regulation:
                     </P><br>
                     <p>- Taxis no longer need to be painted yellow.</p>
                     <p>- High-end app-based Taxis are free to operate, as long as they don't undercut existing rates.</p>
                     <p>- Apps must display car and driver identification, estimated fare, and customer rating. </p>
                     <p>- Per-ride revenue are subject to taxation and audits.</p><br>
                     <p>
                         While Uber currently resists the last requirement, other Uber-like apps are now entering the market. After Uber, the Airbnb deliberation also went well, with Airbnb sending email to all their Taiwan members, urging them to participate online.

                         Uber and Airbnb are hot topics, but other public issues - such as judicial reform, land-use planning, and cultural policy - don't get much coverage. The long-form explanations won't fit into mainstream TV and newspapers, and there are no angle for sensational commentaries.
